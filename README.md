# escaping-ganymede-archival
This repo contains the archival AGS files for Escaping Ganymede. Most of the content in this repository was written from Dec 2020 to Mar 2021.

Several of the assets in this repository have been added to the current version of the project found at [escaping-ganymede](https://github.com/ViciousElia/escaping-ganymede).

Building this archival version of the project requires [Adventure Game Studio](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk), and will result in a dreadfully incomplete version of the game, but a playable demo at least.

The newer version of the Escaping Ganymede project is being built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

Making this repository public as of 09 April 2025.
